### DEMO, read this for a practical example of how the above works:

class DataObj(RegisteredObj):
	def __init__(self, name, a):
		RegisteredObj.__init__(self, name)
		self.a = a
		self.b = None
		self.c = None

@Registry.setup
class DataObjRegistry(Registry):
	child_class = DataObj

if __name__ == '__main__':
	#Demo code

	registry = DataObjRegistry()
	with registry.dataobj('first_obj', 1) as obj1:
		obj1.b = 2

	with registry.dataobj('second_obj', 2) as obj2:
		obj2.b = 3
		obj2.c = 4

	with registry.dataobj('third_obj', 3) as obj3:
		obj1.b = 4

	import random
	def shuffled(lis):
	lis = lis[:]
	random.shuffle(lis)
	return iter(lis)


	for obj_name in shuffled(['first_obj', 'second_obj', 'third_obj']):
		with registry.dataobj(obj_name) as obj:
			print '%s - a: %s, b: %s, c: %s' % (obj.name, obj.a, obj.b, obj.c)
